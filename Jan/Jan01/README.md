# Welcome to January

Doing leetcode problems after a nice short break. Came back from Regina/Denver trip.

Continuing solving Graphs problems.

## Problem 1 - Graph valid tree

1. A tree must be connected and have exactly (n - 1) edges.

One solution is the 'DSU (Disjoint Set Union)' and the other is the traversal (BFS/DFS).

DSU is also called as the Union-Find method.

'iff' - not a typo

'if' implies one-way relation and 'iff' implies two-way relation.

# DSU (Disjoint set union)

1. A disjoint set (aka non-overlapping set) is a collection of sets where no element appears in more than one set.

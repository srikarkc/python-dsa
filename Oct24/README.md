Studying Heaps

## Things to remember about the heaps

1. There's max/min heap - accordingly the value at the top is either the max or the min

2. The higher level higher values but there's no ordering in a level i.e. left node is not necessarily smaller than the right.

3. Not a good data structure for searching for items.

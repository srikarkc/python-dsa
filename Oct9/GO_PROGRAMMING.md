# Go programming language

Watching a quick video about Go programming language to get myself upto speed for Saturday Hackathon.

Go is a statically-typed language; types must be declared and cannot be changed later. 

```go
var myVariable = "String example"
```

In the above example - the 

Strongly typed - the operation you can perform on the variable depends on its data type.

You cannot add a string and an integer together.

GO is compiled not interpreted like Python so it runs faster.

Compilation time for Go is very fast & it has built-in concurrency (go routines).

# Notes

From the Kth Largest element in an array problem - If you keep the k largest elements seen so far in a min-heap, the smallest among them is the kth largest overall.

If you need “top/bottom k” while scanning data, use a heap of size k — min-heap for kth largest (keep big), max-heap for kth smallest (keep small).

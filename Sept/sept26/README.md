# Heaps

Heap is a binary tree.

Each node has a number that is higher than all its descendants.

A Heap is a complete tree - Tree filled from left to right.

Heap can have duplicates.

Max heap or Min heap (all descendants are lower/higher)

A heap can be represented with a list with the position 0 set to None for ease. 

# Priority Queue

You can easily remove the highest value. 

Priority Queues are best implemented using a heap since the most number of operations would be O(log n)

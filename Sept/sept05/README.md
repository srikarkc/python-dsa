Unlike lists that are stored in contiguous memory; linkedlists only contain a pointer to the next node.

## Time Complexity

1. Adding to the end of the list - O(1)
2. Pop from the end of the list - O(n)
3. Adding

### When list is better than a linked list

### When a linked list is better than a list
Prepending and popping off first item better for a linked list

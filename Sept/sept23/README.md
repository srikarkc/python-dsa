# Sept 23, 2025 - Tuesday morning

First revised the 3 problems from yesterday.

## Problem 1 - Anagrams

```python1
my_word = 'hello'
print(sorted(my_word))              # This will create a list
print(''.join(sorted(my_word)))     # This will create a sorted string
```

## Problem 2 - Two sums

## Problem 3 - Subarray sums

This problem is pretty challenging!
